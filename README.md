# Official Implementation of DNPR

> **🎉 News:** We are pleased to announce that **DNPR** has been accepted by **Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA)**!

## 🚧 Repository Status: Code Refactoring
We are currently organizing and cleaning the source code to align with the final accepted manuscript. The repository will be updated incrementally to ensure an "out-of-the-box" experience for the community.

### 📅 Release Roadmap

#### 1. Core Framework (Current Focus)
The implementation of the main method is our priority.
- **Core Logic:** Key modules (PMGR, NME, TPC) are currently available in the `lib/` directory.
- **Inference:** A standardized inference script and configuration files will be released soon.

#### 2. Extended Features (Planned)
To facilitate future research and fair comparison, we also plan to release the following components in **subsequent updates**:
- **Standardized Feature Extraction:** The custom ViT-L/14@336px extraction pipeline used in our experiments.
- **Baseline Implementations:** Scripts/Configs for comparison methods (e.g., WinCLIP, MuSc, APRIL-GAN).

*Thank you for your interest in our work!*
